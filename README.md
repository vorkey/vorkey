<h1 align=center> Hi There 👋 </h1>

<p align=center>Welcome to my profile😇</p>

<h2 align=center> About Me </h2>

Currently a Computer and Networking student at SMKN 2 Tamiang Layang. I learn programming by myself, hence why my code might be of questionable quality. I apologize if in any case reading that might offend anyone.

Nice to meet you.

If you know how to fix any of my broken code be sure to send a pull request🙇‍♂️
